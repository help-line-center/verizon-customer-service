My Experience
-------------

A few months ago, my home internet suddenly stopped working at around 11:30 PM. I didnâ€™t expect support to be available that late, but I called **1-800-837-4966** anyway. Surprisingly, after a short wait, I was connected with a real agent.

The representative ran a quick line test, identified the issue, and helped me reset the ONT box. Within 15 minutes, my service was back online. That night, I learned that Verizon FiOS truly offers 24-hour support, and theyâ€™re capable of solving issues at any hour.
